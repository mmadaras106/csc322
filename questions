Checkpoint 4: images 2 and 3 are different because 3 has a lot less pixels to display the same information. The image is a lot smaller on the screen, so you have to zoom in, and 
              the edges are not smooth like in image 2.
Checkpoint 6: images 2 and 5 are different because 5 is a lot darker. By decreasing the Gamma below 1, the general brightness of the scene decreased and made everything darker

1. Light can pass through an object if it is clear, or reflect off the object specularally like a mirror, or reflect diffusely and scatter
2. Objects have different colors because light contains all colors of visible light and when it hits an object all the colors are absorbed except one, which we see when the
   colored light bounces off the object into our eyes

7. Visible light is a very small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, and different colors have different wavelengths. As the wavelength increases, the color changes.
